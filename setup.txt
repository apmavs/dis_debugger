Download QT installer and install, select MinGW 4.8.2 checkbox
Download and install CMake
Download KDIS v.2.8.0
Download gtest-1.7.0
Download qwt-6.1.2.zip

Extract KDIS
In KDIS, create directory called "build"

Right click Computer->Properties->Advanced system settings. Advanced tab->Environment Variables
Under System variables, edit "Path". Add the following to the end ";C:\Program Files (x86)\CMake\bin;C:\Qt\5.3\mingw482_32\bin;C:\Qt\Tools\mingw482_32\bin"

Open CMake
For "where is the source code:" select the extracted KDIS
For "Where to build the binaries:" select the KDIS/build you created
Click Configure, select "MinGW Makefiles"
Check the "Advanced" box
Add to CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_LIBRARIES and CMAKE_C_STANDARD_LIBRARIES: "-lws2_32"
Find the defined DIS_VERSION and change it to 6!!!!
Click Configure
Click Generate

Open a command prompt
cd to the KDIS/build you created
mingw32-make
<takes a while>
mingw32-make install
If install fails, make sure you open command prompt as administrator

In QT: Tools->options->Version Control->Git
Set "Prepend to PATH:" to your Git/bin directory
This allows you to use git a little with QT, but I would set up the repository from git bash.

Extract gtest-1.7.0, create a build directory inside of it
Open Cmake
For "where is the source code:" select the extracted gtest
For "Where to build the binaries:" select the gtest/build you created
Click Configure, select "MinGW Makefiles"
Click Generate

Open the command prompt
cd to the gtest/build you created
mingw32-make all
Copy gtest-1.7.0/include/gtest to directory that dis_debugger is in
Copy 2 gtest libraries from gtest-1.7.0/build to copied gtest directory


Extract qwt-6.1.2.zip to C:\Qwt-6.1.2
Make using mingw for use with project:
Open cygwin:
cd /c/Qwt-6.1.2
// Remove dll use and force static library
vi qwtconfig.pri and features/qwtconfig.pri
In both files, comment out line 75: QWT_CONFIG += QwtDll
qmake qwt.pro
mingw32-make
mingw32-make install
Create environment variable:
QT_PLUGIN_PATH=C:\Qwt-6.1.2\plugins


// NOTE: In order to use the QWT designer plugin for using in drag/dropping plot widgets,
// you have to build QtCreator under mingw (binary package was built with vc10):
Download QtCreator source 3.3.0
Extract to c:\qt-creator-opensource-src-3.3.0
Open cygwin, cd to /c/qt-creator-opensource-src-3.3.0
mingw32-make -j<NUM AVAILABLE CORES>  // this took over an hour on my laptop
// Backup old QtCreator directories if they existed
cd /c/Qt/Tools/QtCreator
mv lib lib.bak
mv bin bin.bak
mv share share.bak
// Copy new build to QtCreator directory
cd /c/qt-creator-opensource-src-3.3.0
cp -r bin /c/Qt/Tools/QtCreator/
cp -r lib /c/Qt/Tools/QtCreator/
cp -r share /c/Qt/Tools/QtCreator/
