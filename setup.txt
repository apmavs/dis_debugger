Download QT installer and install, select MinGW 4.8.2 checkbox
Download and install CMake
Download KDIS v.2.8.0
Download gtest-1.7.0

Extract KDIS
In KDIS, create directory called "build"

Right click Computer->Properties->Advanced system settings. Advanced tab->Environment Variables
Under System variables, edit "Path". Add the following to the end ";C:\Program Files (x86)\CMake\bin;C:\Qt\5.3\mingw482_32\bin;C:\Qt\Tools\mingw482_32\bin"

Open CMake
For "where is the source code:" select the extracted KDIS
For "Where to build the binaries:" select the KDIS/build you created
Click Configure, select "MinGW Makefiles"
Check the "Advanced" box
Add to CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_LIBRARIES and CMAKE_C_STANDARD_LIBRARIES: "-lws2_32"
Find the defined DIS_VERSION and change it to 6!!!!
Click Configure
Click Generate

Open a command prompt
cd to the KDIS/build you created
mingw32-make
<takes a while>
mingw32-make install
If install fails, make sure you open command prompt as administrator

In QT: Tools->options->Version Control->Git
Set "Prepend to PATH:" to your Git/bin directory
This allows you to use git a little with QT, but I would set up the repository from git bash.

Extract gtest-1.7.0, create a build directory inside of it
Open Cmake
For "where is the source code:" select the extracted gtest
For "Where to build the binaries:" select the gtest/build you created
Click Configure, select "MinGW Makefiles"
Click Generate

Open the command prompt
cd to the gtest/build you created
mingw32-make all
Copy gtest-1.7.0/include/gtest to directory that dis_debugger is in
Copy 2 gtest libraries from gtest-1.7.0/build to copied gtest directory
